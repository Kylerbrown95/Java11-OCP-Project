Part 3

Java Basic Syntax rules
All Java statements must be terminated with ; symbol
Code blocks must be enclosed with { and } 
Indentation and spaces help readability but are irrelevant

Access Classes Across Packages 

import not used when compiled, prefix is automatically added instead so has no effect

Access modifiers
public - Visible to any class
protected - Visible to classes that are in the same package or to subclasses
<default> - Visible only to classes in the same package
private - Visible only within the same class

default means no access modifier is set

main method makes the class an executable and entry point.

Compile Java Program with Javac 

The -classpath or -cp parameter points to locations of other classes that may be required to compile your code
The -d parameter points to a path to store compilation result (The compiler creates package subfolders with compiled class files in the path.)
provide path to src

javac = Java compile 
java = Run code
