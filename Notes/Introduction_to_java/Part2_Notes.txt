Part 2 Notes

Classes

Java code is structured with classes
Class represents a type of thing or concept, such as Dog, Cat, Ball, Person.
Each class defines what kind of information (attributes) it can store:
-A Dog could have a name, colour, size.
-A Ball would have type, material, and so on.
Each class defines what kind of behaviours (operations) containing program logic (algorithms) it is capable of:
-A Dog could bark and fetch a ball
-A Cat could meow but is not likely to play fetch
